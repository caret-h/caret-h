### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me, **caret h**! Nice to meet you!

For those who may not remember, "caret h" (or ^H) on old IBM terminals sent a backspace ("BS") command to delete the last character. This also appeared on many phone-in BBS systems back in the 80s and 90s (where spamming the ^H command in certain circumstances could lead to... *interesting* results.) I find that in both my coding and my fiction writing, the backspace key gets quite a workout, so what better way to honor its contributions to my creative output than to adopt it as a username?

**About me** - I've got an MBA with a concentration in International Business, but right now I'm enrolled in a second bachelors in Management Information Systems, with a minor in Computer Science! I've been taking as many courses dealing directly with programming as possible, and I've learned quite a bit over the last couple years. I currently work in higher education, but I'm excited to find a new career where I can put my expanding knowledge of programming languages to work for me.  I've coded for years as a hobby, but I'm looking forward to getting to use it in my career. There's so much to learn, and all of it is really exciting!

In my free time, aside from coding, I enjoy horseback riding, writing fiction, and playing guitar. I'm very interested in eventually gaining a pilot's license, and I plan to start working towards that soon!

** Skills **
* Current languages I'm studying (*I feel confident working and solving problems in these languages.*)
  * Python
  * C++
  * Java
* I've also been learning some HTML, CSS, and Javascript (*I've got some experience, but I know I still have a lot to learn.*)
* I'm just dipping my toes into databases with a little mySQL. (*Still a beginner, but excited to learn more!*)

* I also used to do a lot in Turbo Pascal and BASICA... but I don't think there's *much* practical use for that knowledge these days. ðŸ˜„

I'm looking forward to sharing the projects I'm working on, and helping out with others' projects as well!
